# AdvanceOfficeChart
  The objective of this extension is to easily provide high quality charts which are not available in OpenOffice. Such a list of charts could be found https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Chart2/ChartTypes.  At present, with this extension, it is possible to plot histogram and boxplot charts and save them in png or svg format. I will try to add Venn diagram and other chart types in future releases of this extension.  
  After installation, restart OpenOffice and the extension will be available from "Tools -> Add-Ons".  Please comment your experience or report any bug.  
  This extension uses JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) library to plot the charts.
